    <p>My current understanding of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>CSS is used to add styling to HTML elements - basically to show how these elements look on the screen, design-wise</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>HTML is used to provide the "skeletal" kind of structure and content for a web page, with some commonly-used elements being heading, paragraph, metatags, forms, lists, etc, the list goes on...</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>JS is used to to provide functionality to web pages, so that users can interact with the content dynamically -- web pages don't just stay static or the same; content can be updated to certain prompts</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
